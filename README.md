# C++ Linked List Project

## Project Description
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a linked list that reads a list of numbers, saves them into a linked list data structure, sorts the list in ascending order, and then outputs the sorted list.

## Features
- **List Input**: Reads a list of numbers from a file.
- **Linked List Creation**: Dynamically creates a linked list to store the numbers.
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Implements a sorting algorithm to order the numbers within the list.
- **Output**: Displays the sorted list to the console.
